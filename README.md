## Current status
The code is very nascent and based on [googler](https://github.com/jarun/googler). I have *discontinued* working on it but ready to guide if someone is interested in carrying it forward.

    $ ddgr KEYWORD [KEYWORD ...]
searches DuckDuckGo for the keywords and fetches the first 30 results. Navigation doesn't work.
